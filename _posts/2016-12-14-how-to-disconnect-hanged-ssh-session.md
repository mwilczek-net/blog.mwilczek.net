Some network issues makes ssh session hangs. Possible solutions are:

- close terminal,
- open new terminal and kill ssh process,
- wait,
- find a good solution.

First three options make us losing data, killing other ssh sessions or loosing our precious time. Simple solution, that helps us avoid possible inconvenience are two characters:

```bash
~ .
```

Tilde and dot is sshâ€™s command to kill session. But remember, it has to be placed immediately after new line character (press enter before).
